# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the CS231n course offered by Stanford University. The assignments cover topics such as image classification, convolutional neural networks, deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow and PyTorch), and adversarial attacks.

Assignments
The course has four assignments, which can be found in their respective directories:



- [Assignment 1: Image Classification, kNN, SVM, Softmax, Fully Connected Neural Network](https://github.com/nothatcreative5/CS231N/tree/master/assignment1/)
- [Assignment 2: Fully Connected and Convolutional Nets, Batch Normalization, Dropout, Pytorch & Network Visualization](https://github.com/nothatcreative5/CS231N/tree/master/assignment2/) 
- [Assignment 3: Image Captioning with RNNs and Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks, Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://github.com/nothatcreative5/CS231N/tree/master/assignment3/)
